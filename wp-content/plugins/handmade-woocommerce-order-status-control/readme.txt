WooCommerce will automatically release a virtual downloadable product for download once payment is received, or, in the case of free products, when an order has been placed. 

== Description ==

WooCommerce will automatically release a virtual downloadable product for download once payment is received, or, in the case of free products, when an order has been placed. 

You may however want to approve all paid or free virtual orders and/or virtual downloadable orders prior to release, depending on your products.

The HandMade WooCommerce Order Status Control extension gives you control over which types of paid orders can be automatically completed, by allowing your WooCommerce store to halt the auto-complete of paid orders for virtual / virtual downloadable / all products, so that you can manually approve or decline the delivery of these products.

The customer will receive an email to inform them that the order has been placed, and the store owner receives a mail with the order details. This allows the store owner to inspect an order and decide whether the product will be released for download, or declined. If the store owner chooses to approve the order the customer will receive another email with the download details of their chosen product(s). The products and the order status will then automatically be changed to 'completed'.

The shop owner has full control over which paid orders can be auto-completed, and which ones require approval:
*	orders that only contain products marked as virtual
*	orders that only contain products marked as virtual and downloadable
*	all paid orders, no matter what product types they contain.

Please note that unpaid orders will not automatically be completed until payment is received.
